DEVICE OPENED: optical wireless mouse.

IC's found :  Avago ADNS- 5090 - Low power optical mouse sensor.

Description: ADNS -5090 is a low power small form factor optical mouse sensor.It is capable of high speed motion detection - upto 30ips and 8 G.  It has onchip oscillator and LED driver to minimise external components.Sensor is programmed via registers through a 4 wire serial port,It is housed in a 8 pin DIP.

Theory of operation:
The ADNS-5090 contains image acquisition system and digital signal processor and 4 wire serial port.Image acquisition system acquires microscopic surface images via lens and illumination system . These images are processed by DSP to determine direction and distance of motion .The DSP calculates the Dx and Dy relative displacement values.
An external microcontroller translates these DX and Dy information from sensor serial port to PS2, USB or RF signals before sending them to host PC.
